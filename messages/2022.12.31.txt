Sublime PICO-8 v2022.12.31

Pico-8 syntax highlighting and the Pico-8 color scheme now use Sublime Text 3 format.

Syntax highlighting is now updated to match Pico-8 0.2.25e, including using the blue background. Additionally, comments to break code into tabs in the Pico-8 editor are highlighted (using the colors of the P8 editor tab bar), as are markers between segments in the .p8 file. Finally, the __gfx__ segment (the sprite sheet) and the __label__ segment (the cartridge label) are colored character-by-character to match the Pico-8 palette, so the sprite sheet can be (sort of) viewed in Sublime Text!

A gray variant of the color scheme is available; you can specify this in your Pico-8 user settings:
"color_scheme": "Packages/PICO-8/PICO-8.sublime-color-scheme"

The color schemes can also be used for Sublime Text in general if you want a Pico-8 feel to all your work!
